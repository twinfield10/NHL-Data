    "# NHL Expected Goals Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will look to create a predictive model using xGBoost to predict the liklihood of a goal occuring on a shot. Using data from 10 NHL seasons, I will look to emulate EvolvingWild's xGoal model using Polars and Pandas (rather than R). I want to give them full credit for the idea of building this model. Their model was built out in R and I wanted to better my skills using Polars, Pandas, and Python using their methodology. I also want to credit Evolving Wild with their incredible ability to pique my interest in building a model of this sort as they are wonderful content creators and ask/answer great questions from the NHL analytic community. The methodology of building this model is heavily based on thier methodology (with some additions from myself) and I do not want to take credit for their work without seriously crediting them. This notebook is essentially a way for me to better my skills in different languages and should be considered a translation of their model from R into Python.\n",
